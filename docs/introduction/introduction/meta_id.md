# MetaId Web3 Identity

Introduction to a new paradigm of web3 identity verification.

In the Web2 era, our identity verification largely depended on centralized identity authorities such as banks, governments, and third-party identity services. While these centralized institutions could provide certain identity verification services, they also posed several issues, such as the risk of user data leakage and cumbersome verification processes. Additionally, major internet companies built their own isolated ecosystems through various apps, trapping user data within these apps, preventing free data flow across different platforms. These companies also exploited their monopolistic advantages to control and profit from user data. Worse still, centralized internet companies often blocked user accounts and restricted the freedom of speech without user consent.

In summary, in the Web2 era, your data did not belong to you but to the internet companies, and your identity did not belong to you but to the government and financial institutions. This centralized method of identity verification not only posed privacy risks but also limited user freedom and negatively impacted user experience.

The emergence of blockchain and Web3 technologies offers a new way of identity verification that does not rely on centralized institutions. Instead, identity management is decentralized through the blockchain's decentralized characteristics.

[MetaId](/docs/blockchain/mvc-improvements/meta-id) is a Web3 identity protocol based on blockchain technology on the MVC platform. It allows users to have a unique identity on the blockchain for identity verification, digital signing, data encryption, and other scenarios. It defines a series of organizational forms for on-chain data, effectively storing and integrating user identity information and various data on the MVC blockchain, and indexing them using the user's private key to control data access and ownership. This design allows users on the MVC platform to not only own tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets but also their identity information and personal data permanently stored on the blockchain. This extends the use of the MVC blockchain from digital assets to a broader domain of "data." This is another reason why the MVC token is called SPACE, representing your data space on the MVC blockchain, where you can store your data, identity, digital assets, and more.

The types of data that MetaId can store and manage are unlimited and include, but are not limited to:

- Basic user information, such as names, avatars, and personal signatures.
- User-generated content, such as posts, articles, and comments.
- User's social connections, such as people they follow and their fans.
- User's transaction records, such as transfer records and purchase history.
- User's digital assets, such as tokens and NFTs.
- User's private data, such as password information and private keys.
- User's preference data, such as favorite playlists and videos watched.


As long as you possess your private key, you can access your MetaId data anytime and anywhere without needing to go through any centralized identity verification authorities. This method of authentication is not only secure and reliable but also convenient and fast. Users can freely control their own data, achieving data autonomy. Additionally, you are no longer dependent on any service providers. Service providers will offer basic blockchain indexing services, and users can easily switch index nodes to freely change service providers, completely freeing themselves from the control of centralized service providers.

Your data will coexist with the MVC blockchain, distributed and stored across global nodes, and will not be lost due to any single point of failure nor exposed due to any single point of attack. This decentralized approach to identity verification will bring users a safer and more liberated online experience.

Additionally, there is MetaFile, a file fragmentation storage and indexing service developed based on MetaId, among many others.

Thus, by using the MVC blockchain, you will have complete data freedom and almost limitless on-chain storage space. Your private key will be your exclusive key to the gateway of Web3. This represents the method of identity verification in the Web3 era and is also a significant application scenario for the MVC blockchain.
