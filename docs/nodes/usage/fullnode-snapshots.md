# Full Node Snapshots 

Full node snapshots are a feature that allows users to download a pre-built copy of the MVC blockchain data up to a certain block height. This feature is useful for new users who want to run a full node without having to download the entire blockchain from scratch. By downloading a snapshot, users can significantly reduce the time and bandwidth required to synchronize their node with the network.

The snapshot is provided by the MVCLabs team and is updated periodically to ensure that new users can download the latest blockchain data. The snapshot includes the entire blockchain up to a specific block height, along with the necessary data files to run a full node.
